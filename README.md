How to approach solving data organisation and analysis, without the use of data analytic libraries.

Admittedly I was keen to use pandas for these challenges as it brings down the amount of code to almost half. 
But, it was an interesting process trying to do it from scratch. I did use a few module imports and took some advice from previously asked questions on stackoverflow.
Challenge #2.b was unsuccessful, athough I knew what needed to be done it was hard to implement it in a way that produced the answer correctly.
Challenge #4 was interesting but also unsuccessful. I knew the datetime module would be key to parsing the dates and producing the right formatted result. 
I had tried several approaches to this using dates x and y as parametrers to find everything in between, but unfortunately it did not work.
